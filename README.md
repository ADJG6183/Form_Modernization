## Project Structure

- `/Form-management`: Main application code
  - `/public/Index`: Web application
    - `/backend`: Python backend code
    - `/static`: Frontend assets (CSS, JS)
    - `/templates`: HTML templates
    - `/uploads`: PDF file storage
    - `/instance`: Database storage
  - `/tests`: Test suite and testing utilities

## PDF Portfolio Approach

This project uses a "PDF Portfolio" approach where:

1. **Base PDF**: The original uploaded PDF document
2. **Surface PDF**: A generated PDF with AcroForm fields overlaid
3. **Field Definitions**: JSON data defining field positions and properties

This approach allows separation of concerns between the document itself and the form fields added to it.

## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```
cd Form-management/tests
pytest test_app.py
```

Run with coverage:

```
pytest --cov=../public/Index test_app.py
```

### Debugging

The application includes built-in diagnostic tools:
- Debug modal in the editor UI
- Error logging API for frontend errors
- PDF loading and field diagnostics
- System information reporting
